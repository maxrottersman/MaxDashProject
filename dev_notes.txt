Notes for if I do a tutorial.

Explain how callbacks worth with the implied passing of variable where names don't matter
Explain how to really work with a call back to change data, you need 
to pu the component create/update out of the app.layout

Explain how you MUST learn
panda dataframes
dictionaries

Dash components work by parsing out settings from dictionaries
so there's no intellisense, you must look them update or help(dcc.Graph)
